    <h1>RB26DETT (2.6L I6 TT)</h1>
    <p>The RB26DETT engine is a 2.6 L (2,568 cc) Inline-six engine manufactured by Nissan, for use in the 1989-2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R. 
        The RB26DETT engine block is made from cast iron, while the cylinder head is made from aluminium alloy, which contains DOHC 4 valves per cylinder (24 valves in total) setup. 
        The intake of the RB26DETT varies from other RB-series motors in that it has six individual (3 sets of 2 throttle assemblies that are siamesed together) instead of a single throttle body. 
        The engine also uses a parallel twin-turbo system, using a pair of T25-type ceramic turbochargers set by the wastegates to limit boost pressure to 10 psi (0.69 bar), although the Skyline GT-R has a built in boost restrictor to keep boost under 14 psi (0.97 bar). 
        The first 2.6 L RB26DETT was rated by Nissan at around 276 bhp (280 PS; 206 kW) at 6,800 rpm and 353 N⋅m; 260 lbf⋅ft (36 kg⋅m) at 4,400 rpm. By the end of production, power levels had gone up to around 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 392 N⋅m; 289 lbf⋅ft (40 kg⋅m) at 4,400 rpm, not only because of developments and modifications to the engine, but also because of the "Gentlemen's Agreement" made between automakers to limit the "advertised" horsepower of any vehicle to 280 PS (276 bhp; 206 kW). 
        While the published figures from Nissan were as quoted above, it has been known among enthusiasts that the car actually had a factory power output closer to the 320 PS (235 kW; 316 hp) figure. 
        The RB26 is widely known and became quite popular for its strength and power potential thanks to its iron block and forged internals, making it a modification friendly platform for tuners and aftermarket modifications in general.</p>
